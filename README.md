[W3 Audio API Working Draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-webaudio-20120802/)

Some experiments with the audio API. 

`strings.js` is an attempt to synthesize strings with JS. Unfortunately, I
[can't seem to tune these
properly](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13153078/web-audio-karplus-strong-string-synthesis),
despite following the [Karplus
Strong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karplus%E2%80%93Strong_string_synthesis)
algorithm properly. I'm messing around to see if I'm doing anything wrong, but
if you read this and you know what I'm doing wrong, please let me know.
